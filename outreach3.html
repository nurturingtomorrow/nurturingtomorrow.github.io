              <h2>Ekiti Outreach</h2>
              <p>
                <b>INTRODUCTION</b><br>
                <b>Egirioke High School, Iyin Ekiti, Ekiti State, Nigeria</b> is situated at Ado/Iyin Road in Ekiti State. The school was established by the Government on the 4th of December, 1978. The school comprises of both primary and secondary session for students.
            <br><br>
                <b>EVENT KICKOFF </b><br>
                Upon the teamâ€™s arrival at the school by 11:30 am, we waited under a shed within the school compound to strategize on the order of programmes and reassign tasks and responsibilities as deemed fit, and we checked the hall prepared for the event and all the students were perfectly seated and waiting for us to start by 12pm. At arrival, we were 4 members, and we prayed and entered the hall at exactly 12pm where all the students gathered. The group of the students are JSS1 and JSS2 primarily, and very few of JSS3 students about 140 of them in total, ranging from the age of 9 to 14 years.
                The school vice principal, in person of Rev. Alabi, welcomed us officially and admonished the students to pay rapt attention to all that will be shared with us and handed us a PAS (Public Address System) owned by the school, and it really made our communication with the students easier and more coordinated, and while that was going on, the other 3 team members joined us in the hall.
<br><br><b>ACTIVITIES</b><br>
Peace Morakinyo led us in the Opening Prayer for like 3 minutes. Taiwo Aluko introduced the Organization to the students and shared the Vision, Mission and Goals of the Organization. He then proceeded to talked on the "Importance of Education" and the qualities that determines a glorious future. The session helped the students to make decisions to be more passionate about academics and become the best because they have been made to understand that education makes a difference even in society. Jesutola Oladapo was the second speaker, and she spoke on <b>"Believe in Yourself" </b> - that amidst challenges and limitations, students should be audacious, and not be afraid to dream big. She emphasized on successful people today who had their times of failure, but never gave up at all. The students therefore determined to become what they have dreamt and imagined and we saw one of them, who wants to become a doctor, no matter what.  The session allowed students to ask questions too, and it was indeed impactful. Oluwadunsin Falodun, our final speaker, reminded the students about the God - factor and that it is very important that students accept the gift of salvation made available by God to all mankind through Christ Jesus, and majority of the students rededicated their heart to God. 
After this, the School Principal appreciated the Team for their visit, and then prayed for the Organization at large. 
<br><br>
<b>DISTRIBUTION OF GIFTS AND PHOTOGRAPHS </b><br>
The available items include 40 leaves exercise books, 150 copies, 3 packs of pens (50 pieces each) total of 150 pieces, and 3 packs of Biscuits (48 pieces) total of 144 biscuits. Roseline Oluwadamisi, Ayobami Ige, James Olumoroti, were in charge of the distribution, assisted by other team members. 
Only 6 books were reserved for the Team Members, aside from Taiwo Aluko, while all the remaining items were shared with the students, each got a book, a pen, and a biscuit. The remaining 6 pens were distributed to the senior students who coordinated the students. Photographs were taken as distribution was going and a group photograph after the distribution. 
In addition, we bought drinks and biscuits for the teachers, the principal, and Vice Principal. 
<br><br>
<b>CONCLUSION </b><br>
Taiwo Aluko appreciated the school authority for their support and the students for their participation and then encouraged the students to begin to implement everything they had learnt, and the students were dismissed and returned to their classes. 

Also, he appreciated the Team members that were present and introduced them to one another, as some were meeting themselves physically for the first time, though there have been interactions on the WhatsApp group. We took photographs and left the school at once. 

It is indeed a wonderful time with the students.
